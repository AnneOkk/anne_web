      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thriving at work has been defined as employees’ joint sense of vitality and learning. Based on the socially
embedded model of thriving at work, we examine several competing operationalizations of thriving at
work. We hypothesize effects of (a) composite thriving, (b) separate vitality and learning scores, and (c)
the interaction between vitality and learning, and we explore effects of (d) the congruence between
vitality and learning on self-rated physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-we-found&#34;&gt;What we found:
  &lt;a href=&#34;#what-we-found&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data came from n = 1,064 employees who
participated in a four-wave study with one-month time lags. Results of multilevel linear and polynomial
regression analyses showed that composite thriving was positively related to physical health, and
composite thriving and vitality were positively related to mental health at the within-person level. We
found no support for interaction or congruence effects. The findings provide limited support for the
assumed beneficial health effects of thriving on employees’ health.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-this-means&#34;&gt;What this means:
  &lt;a href=&#34;#what-this-means&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implications for theory development
include the need to revise the role of vitality and learning as predictors of physical and mental health in
the model of thriving at work.&lt;/p&gt;
