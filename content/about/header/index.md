<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a data scientist and researcher in the Human-AI interaction group at the University of Munich (LMU). 
I completed my Ph.D. in Organisational Behavior at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I discovered my passion for data science and data-based storytelling in the past years. In my current role, I combine data science and academic skills to assess the opportunities and challenges of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in mental healthcare. 
Next to my role as a researcher, I teach individuals and groups how to use and collaborate on projects in R and Quarto for their data analysis and reporting purposes.
