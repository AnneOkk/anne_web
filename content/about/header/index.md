It is great to have you visiting my website! As of June 2022, I am a data scientist and researcher in the Human-AI-Interaction Group at the University of Munich (LMU). Before this, I completed my Ph.D. in Organisational Behavior at the University of Groningen. During this time I developed a passion for data science and data-based storytelling. In my current role, I explore the opportunities and challenges of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in mental healthcare. Furthermore, I provide teaching and guidance for individuals and groups to use and collaborate with R for data analysis and reporting purposes.
