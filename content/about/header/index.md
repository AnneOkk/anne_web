Nice that you are visiting my website. I started working as a data scientist and researcher in the [Human-AI-Interaction Group](https://www.en.peoplemanagement.uni-muenchen.de/human_ai_interaction/index.html) at the University of Munich (LMU) in June 2022. In the previous three years, I completed my Ph.D. in Organisational Behavior at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. I discovered my passion for data science and data-based storytelling during that time. In my current role, I combine data science and academic skills to assess the opportunities and challenges of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in mental healthcare. Next to my role as a researcher, I teach individuals and groups how to use and collaborate on projects in R for data analysis and reporting purposes.
