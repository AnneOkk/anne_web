summary: We wrote a review on AI-enabled precision psychiatry patents published between 2015 and mid-October 2022. Multiple analytic approaches, such as graphic network analysis and topic modeling, are used to analyze the scope, content, and trends of the retained patents. The tools described aim to provide diagnosis, prediction of treatment responses, and prognosis of mental disorder symptoms. Additionally, about one-third of the tools suggest treatment options related to selection, adjustment, and management. The complexity of technology combinations has increased over the years. This review highlights the potential of AI-enabled precision psychiatry tools for adoption in practice.
