PCI Registered Reports (PCI RR) is a dedicated community that reviews and recommends Registered Reports across different disciplines. The two-stage process involves reviewing study proposals and pre-accepting them (before research is conducted). Authors of recommended RRs have the option to publish in PCI RR-friendly journals. PCI RR aims to become a central hub for Registered Reports in all areas of research. For more info, please visit the [PCI RR Website](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/).
